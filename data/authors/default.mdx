Hi! I'm Karuna Solanki.

Masters of Computer Science in User Experience Design.

I design stories, not just screens - blending logic and heart to craft experiences that feel right and work right. From code to design, I bridge both worlds to build products people actually enjoy.

With 3+ years of experience, I’ve helped shape intuitive, impactful digital products that people actually enjoy using.

Let’s make something meaningful together.
