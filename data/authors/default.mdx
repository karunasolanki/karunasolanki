I am Karuna Solanki, Masters of Computer Science in User Experience Design. I design beyond the pixels - Design is about telling stories, guiding users seamlessly, and making an impact.

Code taught me logic, but design stole my heart. My journey from development to UX/UI means I bridge both worlds, crafting experiences that are as beautiful as they are buildable.

With 3+ years of experience, Iâ€™ve helped shape intuitive, impactful digital products that people actually enjoy using.

I enjoy designing not in a sense that it is work but when I do it, I put my whole heart in it.
