I am Karuna Solanki, Masters of Computer Science in User Experience Design.

I design stories, not just screens - blending logic and heart to craft experiences that feel right and work right.

Code taught me logic, but design taught me that logic is well delivered if the interactions is seamless with the user. My journey from development to UX/UI means I bridge both worlds, crafting experiences that are as beautiful as they are buildable.

With 3+ years of experience, Iâ€™ve helped shape intuitive, impactful digital products that people actually enjoy using.
