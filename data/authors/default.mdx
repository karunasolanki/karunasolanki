I am Karuna Solanki, **Masters of Computer Science in User Experience Design.**

<br />

The first rule of being a designer is actually knowing who you're designing for. I believe design isn’t just about making things pretty, it’s about making them make sense.
Code taught me structure and logic. Design? It taught me that logic falls flat if the experience feels like a Rubik’s cube with no solution. From developer to designer, I now live at the sweet spot between “can it be built?” and “will anyone even use it?”, blending both to create experiences that work and wow.

<br />

With **3+ years of experience**, I’ve helped shape intuitive, impactful digital products that people actually enjoy using.
