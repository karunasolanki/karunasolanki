I believe great design is way more than just pixels on a screen - it's about telling stories, guiding users seamlessly, and making an impact.

I switched my career to designing from development since development allowed me to build functional products, I was constantly drawn to the design side, how users interact with a product, what makes an interface intuitive, and how aesthetics can enhance usability. I wanted to bridge the gap between functionality and user satisfaction

My development background gives me a unique edge in understanding technical constraints while designing solutions that are not only beautiful but also feasible and efficient.
