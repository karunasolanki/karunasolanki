- **Role**: UI/UX Designer at Corbado
- **Contribution**: UX research, developer workflows, end-to-end design and visuals.

---

## Overview

Passkeys are the future of secure, passwordless login, but for many developers and enterprises, implementing them can feel overwhelming. At Corbado, with the support and constant collaboration of team, led the end-to-end UX and UI design of our developer tools, website, and enterprise support systems to make passkey adoption clear, intuitive, and efficient.

---

## My Role

My role spanned product thinking, interface design, developer workflows, and enterprise use cases. Designed key components like the developer panel, Passkey Analyzer, Demo Playground, and reusable login modules, while also shaping the full digital experience, from blog structure to enterprise onboarding hubs.

- Designed four major tools: **State of Passkeys**, **Passkeys Analyzer**, **Passkeys Demo**, and **Passkey Debugger**.
- Created user flows for both **iOS** and **Android** passkey integration journeys.
- Designed the developer panel UI and supporting visuals for marketing (LinkedIn, Product Hunt, Blog).

---

## Problem

Passkeys are a secure, passwordless login method, but they’re still a black box for many developers. Corbado needed tools and components that made it easy for developers & enterprises to understand, test, and implement passkeys without diving deep into specs.

---

## Solution

### Passkeys Login UI Components

- Reusable modules: Sign in with Passkey, fallback login, enroll flow.
- Responsive design: Desktop & mobile.
- Customization: White-labeling & accessibility.

### Enterprise Implementation for Australian Government Agency

- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to tailor passkey flows.
- Designed enterprise-ready flows for onboarding, fallback, error states.
- Optimized for varying levels of tech literacy.

**NOTE:** Due to confidentiality agreements, I can't share the full visual implementation of our passkey solution for Austrlian Government Agency, a major government client in Australia.

### Developer Tooling Interfaces

- **Demo Playground** – interactive test environment.
- **State of Passkeys** – compatibility checker.
- **Analyzer & Debugger** – inspect, parse, and fix passkey issues.
- Designed with mental models of both devs and enterprise engineers.

  - Step-by-step onboarding flows.
  - Platform comparisons.
  - Educational content (FAQs, use cases, etc.).

      }}
    />
  </a>

- **Visual Consistency**: Ensured consistent branding across all pages using a custom component library (Tailwind-based).
- **Conversion-Oriented Pages**: Worked closely with marketing to design pricing, feature breakdown, and CTA sections optimized for signups.

## Process

### 1. Research & Pain Point Mapping

- For various design components and usability flow and architecture, followed a path of conducting BDP researches of relevant companies in the same sector of authentication and security. This lead to a simplified and easy understanding of what and how to initiate with the solution primarily rectifying user needs and pain points.

### 2. User Flows & Wireframes

- Created low-fidelity flows for each tool, focusing on minimizing cognitive load for developers.
- Prioritized progressive disclosure: simple entry, detailed options and easy optimized navigation when needed.

### 3. Visual Design

- Used **Tailwind-based** design system aligned with Corbado's brand.
- Designed interactive states, hover effects, and dark mode variants.

### 4. Iteration & Developer Feedback

- Conducted feedback rounds with early adopters and internal teams.
- Iterated on UI and added tooltips, helper texts, and better error messages based on feedback.

---

## Outcome

- Our team successfully implemented a tailored passkey solution for Austrlian Government Agency, a major government client.
- Together, we reduced developer onboarding time by creating intuitive, self-service tools.
- The tools were well-received and featured in passkey conversations across platforms like Product Hunt and LinkedIn.
- These efforts contributed to Corbado's growing recognition as a trusted passkey enabler in the developer community.

---

## Reflection

- Designing for developers requires clarity, precision, and empathy.
- My key learning was the power of **progressive disclosure**: letting users start simple, but offering depth when they need it.
- By focusing on real pain points and iterative feedback, we made passkeys approachable and actionable.
