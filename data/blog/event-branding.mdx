## Seminar Booth Design - Corbado at FIDO Alliance Seminar 2025

### Booth Setup (Company event)

The booth was designed to reflect a balance between **informational clarity** and **brand consistency**. I used a modular layout so that the design could scale across future booths, pamplets and pop-ups.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: '1rem', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 500px' }}>
    <img
    src="/static/images/corbado-booth-design.jpeg"
    alt="Corbado Booth Design - FIDO Alliance Seminar 2025"
    style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '0rem' }}
  />
  </div>

## The Best Part

When people appreciated the designs in a "PURE TECH CONFERENCE" and enjoyed taking pictures, collecting goodies and embracing the designs throughout. The conference and seminar received great feedback for their **professional, clear, and inviting look**. The visuals helped create a unified brand experience from digital channels to physical presence.
