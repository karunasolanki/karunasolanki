# Sustain Feed: Fighting Food Waste with Technology

## Overview

**Sustain Feed** is a food donation mobile app I designed to bridge the gap between food surplus sources and communities in need. It connects restaurants, cafes, and food businesses with NGOs and volunteers, making the donation and redistribution of leftover food easy, safe, and trackable.

## Problem Statement

Every day, tons of edible food go to waste while millions of people face hunger. Restaurants often have surplus food but lack the infrastructure or partners to donate it quickly and safely.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Design an easy-to-use mobile app that:

- Enables food businesses to post surplus food listings
- Allows NGOs to claim donations and track deliveries
- Encourages safe, hygienic, and transparent food redistribution

---

## ðŸ§  Research

I conducted interviews with:

- 5 restaurant owners (to understand surplus generation and barriers to donation)
- 4 NGO staff (to learn about operational challenges in food collection)
- 8 potential volunteers (to discover motivations and needs)

**Key Insights:**

- Businesses want a hassle-free process with minimal effort.
- NGOs care about food safety and timely pickups.
- Volunteers need a reliable system with clear routes and coordination.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution

### 3 User Types:

1. **Donors**: Restaurants and cafes posting surplus food listings.
2. **NGOs**: Organizations claiming food and arranging pickups.
3. **Volunteers**: Helpers who deliver food to communities.

---

## Design Highlights

### ðŸ“² Easy Listing Creation

Donors can quickly list surplus food by uploading photos, quantity, and pickup time.

### ðŸ”„ Claim & Track Donations

NGOs can browse listings, claim them, and track pickup status.

### ðŸšš Volunteer Coordination

Volunteers get notified about routes and timing, with in-app maps.

---

## Impact

- Streamlined the donation process from 1 hour (calls, manual coordination) to under 5 minutes.
- Reduced food wastage and improved delivery efficiency.
- Encouraged community participation through a gamified volunteer system.

---

## Learnings

- Designing for multiple user groups requires balancing conflicting needs.
- Simplicity and speed are key when dealing with perishable food.
- Gamification can boost engagement in social impact apps.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate food safety checklists.
- Expand to include grocery stores and event caterers.
- Add analytics for NGOs to report impact.
