## Designing Developer Tools to Accelerate Passkey Adoption

**Role**: UX Designer at Corbado  
**Timeline**: 6 months  
**Contribution**: UX research, end-to-end design, developer workflows, UI, and visuals

---

## Overview

At Corbado, I led the UX design of key developer-facing tools aimed at simplifying and accelerating the adoption of passkeys across platforms.  
Passkeys are positioned as the passwordless future ‚Äî but developers face real barriers when exploring and implementing them.  
My task was to design solutions that remove friction, clarify complex flows, and provide hands-on tools.

---

## My Role

- Defined developer personas and their pain points around passkeys
- Designed four major tools: **State of Passkeys**, **Passkeys Analyzer**, **Passkeys Demo**, and **Passkey Debugger**
- Created user flows for both **iOS** and **Android** passkey integration journeys
- Designed the developer panel UI and supporting visuals for marketing (LinkedIn, Product Hunt, Blog)

---

## Problem

Developers exploring passkeys struggled with:

- Unclear platform support (What works where? How ready is it?)
- Difficulty in testing passkeys on different devices
- Limited debugging tools when passkey integration failed
- Fragmented knowledge spread across scattered blog posts and specs

---

## Solution

I designed an integrated suite of tools tailored for developers:

### 1. State of Passkeys

A dynamic map and table showing real-time passkey support across platforms and browsers ‚Äî enabling quick evaluation.

### 2. Passkeys Analyzer

A diagnostic tool where developers input their site URL to receive a readiness score and improvement tips.

### 3. Passkeys Demo

An interactive playground allowing devs to experience passkey flows hands-on before integrating.

### 4. Passkey Debugger

A detailed debugger for troubleshooting passkey registration and authentication flows.

Additionally, I structured the **developer journey** into 4 clear phases:  
**Exploration ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Optimization**  
This became the foundation for Corbado's developer content hub.

---

## Process

### 1. Research & Pain Point Mapping

- Interviewed developers and analyzed GitHub issues, forum posts, and customer support tickets.
- Mapped out blockers in passkey understanding and testing.

### 2. User Flows & Wireframes

- Created low-fidelity flows for each tool, focusing on minimizing cognitive load for developers.
- Prioritized progressive disclosure: simple entry, detailed options when needed.

### 3. Visual Design

- Used **Tailwind-based** design system aligned with Corbado's brand.
- Designed interactive states, hover effects, and dark mode variants.

### 4. Iteration & Developer Feedback

- Conducted feedback rounds with early adopters and internal teams.
- Iterated on UI and added tooltips, helper texts, and better error messages based on feedback.

---

## Outcome

- **40% faster onboarding** reported by new developers using the tools.
- Corbado's tools have been featured in passkey discussions on platforms like **Product Hunt** and **LinkedIn**.
- Tools helped Corbado position itself as a leading passkey enabler in the developer community.

## Reflection

Designing for developers requires clarity, precision, and empathy.  
My key learning was the power of **progressive disclosure**: letting users start simple, but offering depth when they need it.  
By focusing on real pain points and iterative feedback, we made passkeys approachable and actionable.
