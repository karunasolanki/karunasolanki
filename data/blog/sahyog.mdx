# Sahyog App – UX Case Study

### Empowering Indian families in their journey of caregiving for Alzheimer’s

> A UX case study by **Karuna Solanki** (Master Thesis at THI, Germany)

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In India, Alzheimer’s is often misunderstood. Families struggle with denial, lack of knowledge, and inadequate care resources. The challenge?  
Design an educational and support platform to empower family caregivers to detect early signs, improve caregiving practices, and connect with local resources.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Raise awareness and knowledge about Alzheimer’s
- Provide home-based early alert tests
- Connect caregivers with nearby care centers and community support
- Gamify learning to make it engaging for different age groups

---

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

I followed a rigorous **Design Thinking** process over 6 months:

1. **Empathize** – Interviews with family members, caregivers, and care centers in India
2. **Define** – Synthesized data using coding techniques (open, axial, selective)
3. **Ideate** – Concepted interactive educational modules
4. **Prototype** – Created high-fidelity mobile app designs
5. **Test** – Usability tested with two age groups (15-30 & 30-50 years)
6. **Iterate** – Refined based on thematic analysis

## 🧍‍♀️ User Persona

**Family members (ages 15-50)** living with elderly relatives showing early signs of forgetfulness.

---

## 😫 Pain Points

- Lack of basic Alzheimer’s knowledge in families
- Denial phase delays diagnosis and care
- No credible, accessible home test options
- Fragmented caregiving resources in India
- Caregivers feel isolated and unsupported

---

## 💡 Solutions

- Illustrated _situation cards_ to explain care scenarios
- **Progress bar** to self-assess capability level
- At-home **alert tests** for early-stage detection
- Nearby care center search via geo-location
- Gamification: Swipeable cards & role-play scenarios
- Community forums to connect and share

---

## 🧭 Information Architecture

Structured around four key features:

- Home
- **Learn & Test** → Situation Cards → Alert Tests → Capability Progress
- **Community Support** → Forums → Share Experiences
- **Nearby Care** → Search Centers → Contact
- Profile → Save Progress

---

## 🎨 Visual Language

- **Color palette**: Calming blues and greens to reduce anxiety
- **Typography**: Large, accessible fonts for all ages
- **Illustrations**: Friendly Indian-family characters

### 2. Early Alert Test

Simple paper-based cognitive tests with instructions shown on mobile.

### 3. Nearby Centers

**Changes Made:**

- Added _info screens_ before tests explaining credibility
- Improved text sizing for better readability
