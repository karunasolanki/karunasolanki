Home renovations are often overwhelming and confusing—clients struggle with coordination between contractors, unclear pricing, and a lack of creative support.

Kiva solves this by offering:

- A centralized platform to manage every step.
- Transparency in process and pricing.
- Tools and visual guides to support confident decision-making.

---

## Objective

Design a responsive, visually engaging platform that:

- Helps users understand the renovation phases: Plan, Design, Build.
- Offers clear service options and process overviews.
- Highlights completed renovation projects to build trust.
- Encourages project inquiries and quotes.

## Solution Highlights

### 1. Landing Page with Clear Value Proposition

The homepage establishes trust quickly with concise messaging: “Renovations Simplified.” Users immediately see the platform’s value with visuals and a CTA to get a quote.

### 2. Visual Step-by-Step Process

A three-step breakdown (Plan, Design, Build) educates users on what to expect. Each section is paired with visuals and concise copy to minimize cognitive load.

### 3. Quote Integration & Testimonial

A strong testimonial section paired with a prominent “Get your estimate” button encourages users to engage. Personalized messaging reinforces credibility and customer satisfaction.

### 4. Renovation Options

Users can explore renovation categories (Kitchen, Bathroom, Backyard, Basement) with cards highlighting project details and visuals, improving service discovery and engagement.

### 5. Showcase of Past Work

A dedicated gallery section displays transformation stories with before-after visuals, boosting user confidence in the platform's offerings.
