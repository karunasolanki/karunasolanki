## Problem Statement

The **DB Navigator** is Deutsche Bahn’s official mobile app designed to assist passengers in planning and organizing their train journeys. Compared to nearby nations, Deutsche Bahn operates an extensive and well-maintained rail network, providing eﬃcient
and reliable transportation services across Germany and beyond. While DB’s transport network is expensive and reliable, its app lacked the same seamlessness.

---

## Objective

Our goal? Elevate the user experience to meet the standards of Germany’s trusted rail network.

- Improve accessibility and ease of navigation
- Introduce new features like meal addition and live train tracking
- Eliminate UX blockers in booking and support flows

## Design Thinking Process

We followed a structured **Design Thinking** process:

1. **Empathize** – Understand user needs and frustrations
2. **Define** – Frame core usability issues
3. **Ideate** – Generate potential design solutions
4. **Prototype** – Build low-fidelity interfaces
5. **Test** – Gather user feedback
6. **Assess** – Refine based on testing

## Lo-Fi Prototypes & Testing

We undertook the creation of Low-fidelity prototypes to establish a framework for a user interface. By using Low-fidelity prototypes, we were able to facilitate early stage discussions and implement the feedback after usability testings.
